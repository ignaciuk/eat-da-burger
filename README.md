# eat-da-burger

CLI app using Nodejs and MySQL simulating a consumer-facing ordering platform and a business-facing inventory managment system.

## What the project does 

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a button to "eat it". When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Why the project is useful 

The project is a full stack web app utlizing Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project 

Hmm. Pretty sure this is just me.
